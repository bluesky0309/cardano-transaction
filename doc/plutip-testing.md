# CTL integration with Plutip

[Plutip](https://github.com/mlabs-haskell/plutip) is a tool to run private Cardano testnets. CTL provides integration with Plutip via a [`plutip-server` binary](https://github.com/mlabs-haskell/plutip/pull/79) that exposes an HTTP interface to control local cardano clusters.

## Architecture

CTL depends on a number of binaries in `$PATH` to execute Plutip tests:

- `plutip-server` to control `cardano-node`
- [`ogmios`](https://ogmios.dev/)
- [`ogmios-datum-cache`](https://github.com/mlabs-haskell/ogmios-datum-cache)
- PostgreSQL: `initdb`, `createdb` and `psql` for `ogmios-datum-cache` storage
- `ctl-server`: a server-side part of CTL itself.

All of these are provided by CTL flake (`nix develop`). The services are NOT run by docker-compose, they are started and stopped on each CTL `Contract` execution by CTL.

## Testing contracts

The main entry point to the testing interface is `Contract.Plutip.runPlutipContract` function:

```purescript
runPlutipContract
  :: forall (distr :: Type) (wallets :: Type) (a :: Type)
   . UtxoDistribution distr wallets
  => PlutipConfig
  -> distr
  -> (wallets -> Contract () a)
  -> Aff a
```

`distr` is a specification of how many wallets and with how much funds should be created. It should either be a `unit` (for no wallets) or nested tuples containing `Array BigInt` - each element of the array specifies an UTxO amount in Lovelaces (0.000001 Ada).

`wallets` argument is either a `Unit` or a tuple of `KeyWallet`s (with the same nesting level as in `distr`, which is guaranteed by `UtxoDistribution`).

`wallets` should be pattern-matched on, and its components should be passed to `withKeyWallet`:

An example `Contract` with two actors:

```purescript
let
  distribution :: Array BigInt /\ Array BigInt
  distribution =
    [ BigInt.fromInt 1000000000
    , BigInt.fromInt 2000000000
    ] /\
      [ BigInt.fromInt 2000000000 ]
runPlutipContract config distribution \(alice /\ bob) -> do
  withKeyWallet alice do
    pure unit -- sign, balance, submit, etc.
  withKeyWallet bob do
    pure unit -- sign, balance, submit, etc.
```

Note that during execution WebSocket connection errors may occur. However, payloads are resent after these errors, so you can ignore them. [These errors will be suppressed in the future.](https://github.com/Plutonomicon/cardano-transaction-lib/issues/670).
