# CTL integration with Plutip

[Plutip](https://github.com/mlabs-haskell/plutip) is a tool to run private Cardano testnets. CTL provides integration with Plutip via [`plutip-server` binary](https://github.com/Plutonomicon/cardano-transaction-lib/tree/develop/plutip-server) that exposes an HTTP interface to control local Cardano clusters.

## Architecture

CTL depends on a number of binaries in the `$PATH` to execute Plutip tests:

- `plutip-server` to launch a local `cardano-node` cluster
- [`ogmios`](https://ogmios.dev/)
- [`kupo`](https://cardanosolutions.github.io/kupo/)

All of these are provided by CTL's `overlays.runtime` (and are provided in CTL's own `devShell`). You **must** use the `runtime` overlay or otherwise make the services available in your package set (e.g. by defining them within your own `overlays` when instantiating `nixpkgs`) as `purescriptProject.runPlutipTest` expects all of them; an example of using CTL's overlays is in the [`ctl-scaffold` template](../templates/ctl-scaffold/flake.nix#L35).

The services are NOT run by `docker-compose` (via `arion`) as is the case with `launchCtlRuntime`: instead they are started and stopped on each CTL `ContractTest` execution by CTL itself.

If you have based your project on the [`ctl-scaffold` template](../templates/ctl-scaffold) then you have two options to run Plutip tests:
1. `nix develop` followed by `npm run test` (recommended for development)
2. `nix run .#checks.x86_64-linux.ctl-scaffold-plutip-test`
   * where you'd usually replace `x86_64-linux` with the system you run tests on
   * and `ctl-scaffold-plutip-test` with the name of the plutip test derivation for your project;
   * note that building of your project via Nix will fail in case there are any PureScript compile-time warnings.

## Testing contracts

CTL can help you test the offchain `Contract`s from your project (and consequently the interaction of onchain and offchain code) by spinning up a disposable private testnet via Plutip and making all your `Contract`s interact with it.

There are two approaches to writing such tests.

### Testing with Mote

#### Overview

[Mote](https://github.com/garyb/purescript-mote) is a DSL for defining and grouping tests (plus other quality of life features, e.g. skipping marked tests).

First (and more widely used) approach is to first build a tree of tests (in CTL's case a tree of `ContractTest` types -- basically a function from some distribution of funds to a `Contract a`) via Mote and then use the `Contract.Test.Plutip.testPlutipContracts` function to execute them.
This allows to set up a Plutip cluster only once per top-level groups and tests passed to the `testPlutipContracts` and then use it in many independent tests.
The function will interpret a `MoteT` (effectful test tree) into `Aff`, which you can then actually run.

The [`ctl-scaffold` template](../templates/ctl-scaffold) provides a simple `Mote`-based example.

`Contract.Test.Plutip.testPlutipContracts` type is defined as follows:
```purescript
testPlutipContracts
  :: PlutipConfig
  -> TestPlanM ContractTest Unit
  -> TestPlanM (Aff Unit) Unit
```

It takes a plutip config and a tree of Mote tests, where tests are of type `ContractTest`.

To create tests of type `ContractTest`, you should either use `Contract.Test.Plutip.withWallets` or `Contract.Test.Plutip.noWallet`:

```purescript
withWallets
  :: forall (distr :: Type) (wallets :: Type)
   . UtxoDistribution distr wallets
  => distr
  -> (wallets -> Contract Unit)
  -> ContractTest

noWallet :: Contract Unit -> ContractTest
noWallet test = withWallets unit (const test)
```

Usage of `testPlutipContracts` is similar to that of `runPlutipContract`, and distributions are handled in the same way. Here's an example:

```purescript
suite :: MoteT Aff (Aff Unit) Aff
suite = testPlutipContracts config do
  test "Test 1" do
    let
      distribution :: Array BigInt /\ Array BigInt
      distribution = ...
    withWallets distribution \(alice /\ bob) -> do
      ...

  test "Test 2" do
    let
      distribution :: Array BigInt
      distribution = ...
    withWallets distribution \alice -> do
      ...

  test "Test 3" do
    noWallet do
      ...
```

#### Using Mote testing interface

To define tests suites you can use `test`, group them with `group` and also wrap tests or groups with `bracket` to execute custom actions before and after tests/groups that are inside the bracket.
Note that in Mote you can define several tests and several groups in a single block, and bracket that wraps them will be run for each such test or group.

Internally `testPlutipContracts` places a bracket that sets up the CTL environment and starts up the Plutip cluster on the top level, so if you want to launch cluster only once wrap your tests or groups in a single group.
In the example above the environment and cluster setup will happen 3 times.

#### Internal implementation overview

`Contract.Test.Plutip.testPlutipContracts` type is defined as follows (after expansion of the CTL's `TestPlanM` type synonym):
```purescript
type TestPlanM :: Type -> Type -> Type
type TestPlanM test a = MoteT Aff test Aff a

testPlutipContracts
  :: PlutipConfig
  -> MoteT Aff ContractTest Aff Unit
  -> MoteT Aff (Aff Unit) Aff Unit

-- Recall that `MoteT` has three type variables
newtype MoteT bracket test m a
```
where
* `bracket :: Type -> Type` is where brackets will be run (before/setup is `bracket r` and after/shutdown is of type `r -> bracket Unit`),
   * in our case it's `Aff` and is where the CTL environment and Plutip cluster setup will happen,
   * also environment setup and Plutip startup and teardown will happen once per each top-level test or group inside the `testPlutipContracts` call,
   * so wrap your tests or groups in a single group if you want for the cluster to start only once,
* `test :: Type` is a type of tests themselves,
   * in our case it's [`ContractTest`](../src/Internal/Test/ContractTest.purs), which in a nutshell describes a function from some wallet UTxO distribution to a `Contract r`
   * wallet UTxO distribution is the one that you need to pattern-match on when writing tests
* `m :: Type -> Type` is a monad where effects during the construction of the test suite can be performed,
   * here we use `Aff` again
* `a :: Type` is a result of the test suite, we use `Unit` here.

`testPlutipContracts` also combines distributions of individual tests in a single big distribution (via nested tuples) and modifies tests to pluck their required distributions out of the big one.
This allows to create wallets and fund them in one step, during the Plutip setup.
See the comments in the [`Ctl.Internal.Plutip.Server` module](../src/Internal/Plutip/Server.purs) for more info (relevant ones are in `execDistribution` and `testPlutipContracts` functions).

In complicated protocols you might want to execute some `Contract`s in one test and then execute other `Contract`s which depend on some wallet-dependent state set up by the first batch of contracts, e.g. some authorization token is present at some wallet.
Keeping these steps in separate sequential tests allows to pinpoint where things failed much easier, but currently CTL uses separate wallets for each test without an easy way to refer to wallets in other tests, so you have to call first batch of contracts again to replicate the state of the wallets, which in turn might fail or mess up your protocol, because the chain state is shared between tests for each top-level group.
There's a patch to CTL you can adapt (and even better -- make a PR) if you need to share wallets between tests right now, see the [limitations](#limitations) doc for more info.
This functionality will probably be added to CTL later.

### Testing in Aff context

Second approach is to use the `Contract.Test.Plutip.runPlutipContract` function, which takes a single `Contract`, launches a Plutip cluster and executes the passed contract.
This function runs in `Aff`; it will also throw an exception should contract fail for any reason.
After the contract execution the Plutip cluster is terminated.
You can either call it directly from your test's main or use any library for grouping and describing tests which support effects in the test body, like Mote.

`Contract.Test.Plutip.runPlutipContract`'s function type is defined as follows:

```purescript
runPlutipContract
  :: forall (distr :: Type) (wallets :: Type) (a :: Type)
   . UtxoDistribution distr wallets
  => PlutipConfig
  -> distr
  -> (wallets -> Contract a)
  -> Aff a
```

`distr` is a specification of how many wallets and with how much funds should be created. It should either be a `Unit` (for no wallets), nested tuples containing `Array BigInt` or an `Array (Array BigInt)`, where each element of the inner array specifies an UTxO amount in Lovelaces (0.000001 Ada).

The `wallets` argument of the callback is either a `Unit`, a tuple of `KeyWallet`s (with the same nesting level as in `distr`, which is guaranteed by `UtxoDistribution`) or an `Array KeyWallet`.

`wallets` should be pattern-matched on, and its components should be passed to `withKeyWallet`:

An example `Contract` with two actors using nested tuples:

```purescript
let
  distribution :: Array BigInt /\ Array BigInt
  distribution =
    [ BigInt.fromInt 1_000_000_000
    , BigInt.fromInt 2_000_000_000
    ] /\
      [ BigInt.fromInt 2_000_000_000 ]
runPlutipContract config distribution \(alice /\ bob) -> do
  withKeyWallet alice do
    pure unit -- sign, balance, submit, etc.
  withKeyWallet bob do
    pure unit -- sign, balance, submit, etc.
```

An example `Contract` with two actors using `Array`:

```purescript
let
  distribution :: Array (Array BigInt)
  distribution =
    -- wallet one: two UTxOs
    [ [ BigInt.fromInt 1_000_000_000, BigInt.fromInt 2_000_000_000]
    -- wallet two: one UTxO
    , [ BigInt.fromInt 2_000_000_000 ]
    ]
runPlutipContract config distribution \wallets -> do
  traverse_ ( \wallet -> do
                withKeyWallet wallet do
                  pure unit -- sign, balance, submit, etc.
            )
            wallets
```

In most cases at least two UTxOs per wallet are needed (one of which will be used as collateral, so it should exceed `5_000_000` Lovelace).


Internally `runPlutipContract` runs a contract in an `Aff.bracket`, which creates a Plutip cluster on setup and terminates it during the shutdown or in case of an exception.
Logs will be printed in case of an error.

### Writing checks in tests

CTL will run contracts in your test bodies and will print errors for any failed tests.
For more complex checks you can use the [assertions library](./test-utils.md).

### Note on running clusters

The communication with Plutip happens via the `plutip-server`'s HTTP interface, which allows to start or stop a cluster.
[`plutip-server`](../plutip-server) allows only once active cluster at a time.
CTL currently launches `plutip-server` and `kupo` on pre-defined ports, so you won't be able to launch multiple environments to get parallel cluster.

<!-- TODO: uncomment and update this in case CTL adds support for configuring ports for kupo, plutip-server, etc. -->
<!-- but nothing stops you from setting up multiple CTL environments and multiple `plutip-server`s by running tests in separate fibers and thus using multiple Plutip clusters simultaneously. One caveat is that nodes in different clusters might get assigned the same port (see [this](https://github.com/mlabs-haskell/plutip/blob/master/README.md#note-on-running-multiple-clusters) Plutip doc) and then race to use it, which will result in one cluster starting fine and another repeatedly failing. The way to deal with this is to start another environment and try again. -->

### Note on SIGINT

Due to `testPlutipContracts`/`runPlutipContract` adding listeners to the SIGINT IPC signal, Node.js's default behaviour of exiting on CTRL+C no longer occurs. This was done to let cluster cleanup handlers run asynchronously. To restore the usual exit-by-CTRL+C, we provide helpers to cancel an `Aff` fiber and set the exit code, to let Node.js shut down gracefully when no more events are to be processed.

```purescript
...
import Contract.Test.Utils (exitCode, interruptOnSignal)
import Data.Posix.Signal (Signal(SIGINT))
import Effect.Aff (cancelWith, effectCanceler, launchAff)

main :: Effect Unit
main = interruptOnSignal SIGINT =<< launchAff do
  flip cancelWith (effectCanceler (exitCode 1)) do
    ... test suite in Aff ...
```

### Testing with Nix

You can run Plutip tests via CTL's `purescriptProject` as well. After creating your project, you can use the `runPlutipTest` attribute to create a Plutip testing environment that is suitable for use with your flake's `checks`. An example:

```nix
{
  some-plutip-test = project.runPlutipTest {
    name = "some-plutip-test";
    testMain = "Test.MyProject.Plutip";
    # The rest of the arguments are passed through to `runPursTest`:
    env = { SOME_ENV_VAR = "${some-value}"; };
  };
}
```

The usual approach is to put `projectname-plutip-test` in the `checks` attribute of your project's `flake.nix`.
This is done by default in the [`ctl-scaffold` template](../templates/ctl-scaffold/flake.nix).

## Cluster configuration options

`PlutipConfig` type contains `clusterConfig` record with the following options:

```purescript
{ slotLength :: Seconds
, epochSize :: Maybe UInt
, maxTxSize :: Maybe UInt
, raiseExUnitsToMax :: Boolean
}
```

- `slotLength` and `epochSize` define time-related protocol parameters. Epoch size is specified in slots.
- `maxTxSize` (in bytes) allows to stress-test protocols with more restrictive transaction size limits.
- `raiseExUnitsToMax` allows to bypass execution units limit (useful when compiling the contract with tracing in development and without it in production).

### Current limitations

* Non-default values of `epochSize` (current default is 80) break staking rewards - see [this issue](https://github.com/mlabs-haskell/plutip/issues/149) for more info. `slotLength` can be changed without any problems.

## Using addresses with staking key components

It's possible to use stake keys with Plutip. `Contract.Test.Plutip.withStakeKey` function can be used to modify the distribution spec:

```purescript
let
  privateStakeKey :: PrivateStakeKey
  privateStakeKey = wrap $ unsafePartial $ fromJust
    $ privateKeyFromBytes =<< hexToRawBytes
      "633b1c4c4a075a538d37e062c1ed0706d3f0a94b013708e8f5ab0a0ca1df163d"
  aliceUtxos =
    [ BigInt.fromInt 2_000_000_000
    , BigInt.fromInt 2_000_000_000
    ]
  distribution = withStakeKey privateStakeKey aliceUtxos
```

Although stake keys serve no real purpose in plutip context, they allow to use base addresses, and thus allow to have the same code for plutip testing, in-browser tests and production.

Note that CTL re-distributes tADA from payment key-only ("enterprise") addresses to base addresses, which requires a few transactions before the test can be run. These transactions happen on the CTL side, because Plutip can currently handle only enterprise addreses (see [this issue](https://github.com/mlabs-haskell/plutip/issues/103)).

## Limitations
* See the `epochSize` configuration option problem [here](#current-limitations).
* Currently there's no way to share wallets between separate tests (which is useful for complex protocols). You can adapt [this PR](https://github.com/IndigoProtocol/cardano-transaction-lib/pull/1) (needs to be updated for the newer versions of CTL, likely won't need too many changes) if you need it now (and even better -- make a PR to CTL).
* If you've used the [`plutus-simple-model`](https://github.com/mlabs-haskell/plutus-simple-model) library then you might know that it allows to time travel in tests, which can be very useful for testing vesting schedules, etc. Testing with Plutip doesn't allow this, as it's running a real network. A way around this problem can be to parametrize onchain logic by a time multiplier (and use a small one for tests).
