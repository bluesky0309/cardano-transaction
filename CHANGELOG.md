# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) and we follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- `Types.ScriptLookups.require` function naming caused problems with WebPack (#593)

## [1.0.1] - 2022-06-17

### Fixed

- `mustBeSignedBy` now sets the `Ed25519KeyHash` corresponding to the provided `PaymentPubKeyHash` directly. Previously, this constraint would fail as there was no way to provide a matching `PaymentPubKey` as a lookup. Note that this diverges from Plutus as the `paymentPubKey` lookup is always required in that implementation

## [1.0.0] - 2022-06-10

CTL's initial release!
