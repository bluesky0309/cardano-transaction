# ctl-server

This is a small Haskell project to provide services to the `cardano-transaction-lib` frontend that cannot be achieved using Purescript

## Goals

We plan on supporting at least the following features:

- [x] Transaction fee estimation via `Cardano.Api`
- [x] Plutus' `applyArguments` for applying `Data` arguments to scripts
- [x] ~~Obtaining the hash of scripts (e.g. `validatorHash`, etc...)~~

## Development

Run `nix develop .#hsDevShell` (or equivalently `nix develop .#package.x86_64-{linux|darwin}`; NB: not currently tested on macOS) in the repository root (i.e. up one level from `server`). This will place you in a development shell with `cabal`, `hoogle`, `haskell-language-server`, etc...

The server executable can be built with `nix build .#ctl-server:exe:ctl-server` and run with `./result/bin/ctl-server`. `cabal` can also be used once in the development shell. The server will run on port 8081. You can optionally pass the `--port`/`-p` flag to explicitly choose a port to run on
